Web development

Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications that run on the internet.
It involves everything from designing how a site looks to creating how it works behind the scenes.

Frontend Development
Frontend refers to everything the user sees and interacts with in a website. It includes layout, colors, buttons, and text. Developers use technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the frontend. The goal is to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.

Backend Development
The backend is the server side of a website that handles data, logic, and processing. It communicates with the frontend to deliver the information users request. Backend developers use languages like Python, PHP, and Node.js. It ensures the website runs securely and efficiently.

Database
A database stores all the information a website needs, such as user data and content. It allows the backend to read, update, and manage this data. Popular databases include MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. Databases help keep information organized and accessible.

Conclusion
Web development brings together frontend, backend, and databases to create complete and functional websites. Understanding each part helps developers build better web applications.
